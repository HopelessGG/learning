    CONSOLE APPLICATION : Pancake Glutton Project Overview
========================================================================

AppWizard has created this Pancake Glutton application for you.

This file contains a summary of what you will find in each of the files that
make up your Pancake Glutton application.


Pancake Glutton.vcxproj
    This is the main project file for VC++ projects generated using an Application Wizard.
    It contains information about the version of Visual C++ that generated the file, and
    information about the platforms, configurations, and project features selected with the
    Application Wizard.

Pancake Glutton.vcxproj.filters
    This is the filters file for VC++ projects generated using an Application Wizard. 
    It contains information about the association between the files in your project 
    and the filters. This association is used in the IDE to show grouping of files with
    similar extensions under a specific node (for e.g. ".cpp" files are associated with the
    "Source Files" filter).

Pancake Glutton.cpp
    Pancake Glutton
	Requires:
	variables, data types, and numerical operators
	basic input/output
	logic (if statements, switch statements)
	loops (for, while, do-while)
	arrays

	Write a program that asks the user to enter the number of pancakes eaten for breakfast by 10 different people (Person 1, Person 2, ..., Person 10)
	Once the data has been entered the program must analyze the data and output which person ate the most pancakes for breakfast.

	* Modify the program so that it also outputs which person ate the least number of pancakes for breakfast.

	**** Modify the program so that it outputs a list in order of number of pancakes eaten of all 10 people.
	i.e.
	Person 4: ate 10 pancakes
	Person 3: ate 7 pancakes
	Person 8: ate 4 pancakes
	...
	Person 5: ate 0 pancakes
