    CONSOLE APPLICATION : While( user == gullible ) Project Overview
========================================================================

AppWizard has created this While( user == gullible ) application for you.

This file contains a summary of what you will find in each of the files that
make up your While( user == gullible ) application.


While( user == gullible ).vcxproj
    This is the main project file for VC++ projects generated using an Application Wizard.
    It contains information about the version of Visual C++ that generated the file, and
    information about the platforms, configurations, and project features selected with the
    Application Wizard.

While( user == gullible ).vcxproj.filters
    This is the filters file for VC++ projects generated using an Application Wizard. 
    It contains information about the association between the files in your project 
    and the filters. This association is used in the IDE to show grouping of files with
    similar extensions under a specific node (for e.g. ".cpp" files are associated with the
    "Source Files" filter).

While( user == gullible ).cpp
    While( user == gullible )
	Requires:
	variables, data types, and numerical operators
	basic input/output
	logic (if statements, switch statements)
	loops (for, while, do-while)

	Write a program that ccontinues to asks the user to enter any number other than 5 until the user enters the number 5.
	Then tell the user "Hey! you weren't supposed to enter 5!" and exit the program.

	* Modify the program so that after 10 iterations if the user still hasn't entered 5 will tell the user "Wow, you're more patient then I am, you win." and exit.

	** Modify the program so that it asks the user to enter any number other than the number equal to the number of times they've been asked to enter a number. (i.e on the first iteration "Please enter any number other than 0" and on the second iteration "Please enter any number other than 1"m etc. etc. The program must behave accordingly exiting when the user enters the number they were asked not to.)

Other standard files:

StdAfx.h, StdAfx.cpp
    These files are used to build a precompiled header (PCH) file
    named While( user == gullible ).pch and a precompiled types file named StdAfx.obj.

AppWizard uses "TODO:" comments to indicate parts of the source code you
should add to or customize.
