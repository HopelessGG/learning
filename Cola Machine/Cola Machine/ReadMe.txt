    CONSOLE APPLICATION : Cola Machine Project Overview
========================================================================

AppWizard has created this Cola Machine application for you.

This file contains a summary of what you will find in each of the files that
make up your Cola Machine application.


Cola Machine.vcxproj
    This is the main project file for VC++ projects generated using an Application Wizard.
    It contains information about the version of Visual C++ that generated the file, and
    information about the platforms, configurations, and project features selected with the
    Application Wizard.

Cola Machine.vcxproj.filters
    This is the filters file for VC++ projects generated using an Application Wizard. 
    It contains information about the association between the files in your project 
    and the filters. This association is used in the IDE to show grouping of files with
    similar extensions under a specific node (for e.g. ".cpp" files are associated with the
    "Source Files" filter).

Cola Machine.cpp
   Requires:
	variables, data types, and numerical operators
	basic input/output
	logic (if statements, switch statements)

	Write a program that presents the user w/ a choice of your 5 favorite beverages (Coke, Water, Sprite, ... , Whatever).
	Then allow the user to choose a beverage by entering a number 1-5.
	Output which beverage they chose.

	* If you program uses if statements instead of a switch statement, modify it to use a switch statement.
	If instead your program uses a switch statement, modify it to use if/else-if statements.

	** Modify the program so that if the user enters a choice other than 1-5 then it will output "Error. choice was not valid, here is your money back."
