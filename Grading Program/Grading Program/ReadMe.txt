    CONSOLE APPLICATION : Grading Program Project Overview
========================================================================

AppWizard has created this Grading Program application for you.

This file contains a summary of what you will find in each of the files that
make up your Grading Program application.


Grading Program.vcxproj
    This is the main project file for VC++ projects generated using an Application Wizard.
    It contains information about the version of Visual C++ that generated the file, and
    information about the platforms, configurations, and project features selected with the
    Application Wizard.

Grading Program.vcxproj.filters
    This is the filters file for VC++ projects generated using an Application Wizard. 
    It contains information about the association between the files in your project 
    and the filters. This association is used in the IDE to show grouping of files with
    similar extensions under a specific node (for e.g. ".cpp" files are associated with the
    "Source Files" filter).

Grading Program.cpp
    Requires:
	variables, data types, and numerical operators
	basic input/output
	logic (if statements, switch statements)

	Write a program that allows the user to enter the grade scored in a programming class (0-100).
	If the user scored a 100 then notify the user that they got a perfect score.

	* Modify the program so that if the user scored a 90-100 it informs the user that they scored an A

	** Modify the program so that it will notify the user of their letter grade
	0-59 F 60-69 D 70-79 C 80-89 B 90-100 A
